# Willemstad
Named after the capital of Curaçao (which is known for its colourful houses), _Willemstad_ is a snippet/theme variant proof-of-concept for Chris Grieser (pseudometa)'s [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme, [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus).

## Style Settings — Options available as of v0.1.1
Some of you might be interested in _Willemstad_ for its ability to change certain options, which are enabled if [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) is downloaded from the Community Plugin store within Obsidian. They are listed here, so you can refer to it without downloading it first.

### Note!
I use `RGB` for colours, whereas Chris uses `HSL`.
